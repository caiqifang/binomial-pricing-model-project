  "tagline": "",
  "body": "### Welcome\r\nOur goal of this project is to use parallel computing techniques to increase the calculating performance of binomial security pricing model. We will implement the project on Nvidia GPU platforms using CUDA API. In the end, we wish we can build a real-time program that reacts to changes in variables and returns the theoretical prices of securities. Hope this pricing engine can serve as the core of a black-box trading system.\r\n\r\n### Background Information\r\nBinomial security pricing model is a fundamental technique used in the financial industry. The idea of this model is that we can use a binomial tree to describe the evolution of security price. At time 0, we can denote the security price to be S0. At the next time period, the price S0 can evolve into S1(Head) with an up factor of u and S1(Tail) with a down factor of d. A multiple period binomial model is shown in the graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nComputer Platform:\r\nCPU and Nvidia GPU platform (potential benefit from GPU parallel computing)\r\nStarter Code:\r\nAs for now, we do not have any starter code. We plan to start from scratch.\r\nCoding Language:\r\nC/C++\r\nTextbook Reference:\r\nStochastic Calculus for Finance I: The Binomial Asset Pricing Model by Steven E. Shreve. Faculty Advisers:\r\nDr. David Handron (CMU-21370)\r\nProf. William Hrusa (CMU-21378)\r\nProf. Todd C. Mowry (CMU-15418)\r\nProf. Brian Railing (CMU-15418)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
